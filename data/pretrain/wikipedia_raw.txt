Dorothy Garrett Smith (c. 1932 â€“ August 8, 1990) was the first woman to have served as president of the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, which establishes and monitors education policy.
Smith was the president from December 1989 until her sudden death eight months later during the administration of Governor Buddy Roemer.
She represented nine parishes in northwestern Louisiana: Beauregard, Bossier, Caddo, Claiborne, DeSoto, Red River, Sabine, Vernon, and her own Webster.
Smith was either a native of Bastrop in Morehouse Parish in northeast Louisiana or Springhill in northernmost Webster Parish near the Arkansas state line.
According to the "New Orleans Times-Picayune", she graduated from Springhill High School and attended Southern Arkansas University in Magnolia.
However, the "Minden Press-Herald" reported that she did not move to Springhill until 1957, when she was about twenty-five years of age and therefore would not have graduated from Springhill High School.
A Democrat, Smith in the summer of 1970 defeated two opponents to win a seat on the Webster Parish School Board, an institution on which she served for the following sixteen years.
Smith was the parish school board vice-president under presidents Chester Marlon Pope (1929-1987), a Republican from Cotton Valley and Henry Grady Hobbs (1923-2012) and Robert Edward "Bob" Parker, Jr. (born September 1948), both from Minden.
During Smith's time on the parish board, several school grounds in rural communities were closed to the public for after-school use because of growing vandalism. "
As far as we're spending our money for school improvements ... vandalism is tearing it all down," Smith said in expressing regret over the need for the new policy, which allows use of the school facilities for pupils only with adult supervision.
